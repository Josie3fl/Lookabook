<Look A Book>

## Description

Look A Book is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, save their favorite ones, and manage their saved books after logging in. In a world full of scattered book recommendations and reading lists, I wanted to create a centralized place for readers to discover and save books theyâ€™re interested in. I built Look A Book to deepen my understanding of GraphQL, Apollo Client/Server integration, and user authentication using JSON Web Tokens. This app solves the hassle of keeping track of book discoveries across platforms by allowing authenticated users to store and manage their reading list in one place.
Through this project, I learned how to integrate GraphQL with a MongoDB backend, implement secure user authentication, and replace RESTful calls with Apollo Client queries and mutations.
